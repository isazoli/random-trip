SOLID
	Single-responsibility
	Open-closed
		open for extension, closed for modification
	Liskov substitution (LSP)
		Every subclass should be substitutable for their parent.
	Interface segregation
		Favor many smaller, client-specific IFes
	Dependency inversion
		 Entities should depend only on abstractions but not on concretions. 
		 According to it, the high-level module must never rely on any low-level module but should depend on abstractions.
